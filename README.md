# Protect

A lightweight, modern area protection plugin for Paper, built as an API-first
alternative to WorldGuard.

Protect combines flexible region handling (cuboid, cylinder, ellipsoid, grouped,
and global areas), a service API, and powerful flag-based protection rules.

## Why should You use Protect?

- API-first architecture for direct plugin integration.
- Multiple area types out of the box: global, cuboid, cylinder, ellipsoid,
  and grouped regions.
- Powerful flag system with inheritance/priority support for layered protection.
- Built-in quality-of-life commands for members, owners, parents, schematics,
  and automatic protection presets.
